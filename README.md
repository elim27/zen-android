Zen is an Android meditation app I made for fun :)

Zen allows users to improve their mental wellness by keeping track of how much time user's
spend meditating and also how many times they complete a full meditation session (as the 
idea is to finish what we start). The app also tracks user's daily interactions, encouraging
users to come back every day by building a daily streak based on if the user completes a full
session each day.

NOTE: For testing purposes, minutes are seconds (i.e. 5 min = 5 sec) and days are minutes (1 day = 1 min).
